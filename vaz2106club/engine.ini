[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1			; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.16					; engine inertia
LIMITER=7500					; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter
LIMITER_HZ=10					; Frequency of engine limiter
MINIMUM=900					; Idle rpm
DEFAULT_TURBO_ADJUSTMENT=0 			; DEFAULT turbo adjustment if one or more turbos are cockpit adjustable

[COAST_REF]
RPM=6000						; rev number reference
TORQUE=50						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY=0					        ; coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.985						; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.99					; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=1.2 					; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=1.2					; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
DISPLAY_MAX_BOOST=1.2			; Value used by display apps
REFERENCE_RPM=3250				; The reference rpm where the turbo reaches maximum boost (at max gas pedal). 
GAMMA=2						; Turbo pressure sensitivity on accelerator pedal
COCKPIT_ADJUSTABLE=0				; cockpit adjustable turbo pressure
